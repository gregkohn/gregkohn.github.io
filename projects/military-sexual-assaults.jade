Yet of the reports filed, just 13 percent were submitted by men. Baltimore Sun investigative reporter Matthew Hay Brown's award-winning story examines why few victims reported the assaults and even fewer received justice, and features the heart-wrenching stories of men who were attacked and terrorized by their own peers while serving their country.";

Due to the story's serious and emotional nature, the design is almost exclusively monochromatic and &quot;out of the way&quot; - this was not about an interesting design, but about supplementing the writing. For this reason, I opted for a print-style treatment on the headline leading into the reveal of a large, emotive photo. The lead interactive graphic embedded on the page introduced the reader to more stories from assault victims that could not fit into the narrative.";
